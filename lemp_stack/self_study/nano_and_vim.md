# 🖥 Self Study: VIM & Nano Editors

## 🗂 Overview
VIM and Nano are two of the most common text editors in Linux.  
This session was all about becoming comfortable with both — VIM, the “power tool” that scares beginners, and Nano, the “friendly neighborhood editor.”

---

## 🚀 Journey & Backstory
I’ll admit it — VIM had me trapped the first time I opened it.  
I typed my text but couldn’t figure out how to *exit*. After pressing every key in panic, I ended up searching "how to quit VIM" on Google.  
Nano, on the other hand, felt like a warm hug — simple, intuitive, and beginner-friendly.
