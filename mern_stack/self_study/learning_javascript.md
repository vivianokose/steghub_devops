# JavaScript

## Introduction
If HTML is the skeleton of a webpage and CSS is the skin and clothes, **JavaScript (JS)** is the brain that makes everything move, blink, and react. Letâ€™s play with some basics!

## Variables
Variables are like little boxes where you store things.

```javascript
let name = "Naeem";
const age = 25;
var country = "Nigeria";
````

## Functions

Functions are reusable recipes. Write once, use many times.

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
console.log(greet("Vivian")); // Hello, Vivian!
```

## Conditionals

Life is full of decisions. JavaScript handles them with `if`.

```javascript
let score = 80;
if (score >= 50) {
  console.log("Pass ðŸŽ‰");
} else {
  console.log("Fail ðŸ˜¢");
}
```

## Loops

Want to repeat something? Loops have you covered.

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Step " + i);
}
```

## Conclusion

This is just the tip of the iceberg. JavaScript is the language that makes the web alive â€” from dropdown menus to games and even entire web apps.
